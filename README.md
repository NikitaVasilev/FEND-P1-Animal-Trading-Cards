# FEND Project 1: "Animal Trading Cards"

**Project 1: "Animal Trading Cards" for Udacity Front-End Nanodegree/Google Scholarship**

This is my result of the first project "Animal Trading Cards" of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree course.
This project is following all requirements of this [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/151/view).

Actually I made two of them in one single file. The card at the right is the one that meet all the requirements of the project. The card at the left is better looking but not follow all requirements of the project like the border around animal's information or the title at the head of the file.
